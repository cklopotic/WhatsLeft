# WhatsLeft
Simple module to take in a reading from a digital scale, and determine how much beer you have left in the keg.

This has a small 2.8" TFT display attached to a Raspberry Pi, along with a digital scale with some load sensors.  This will weigh your half barrel of beer and estimate how much beer you have remaining in your keg.

I embedded the dislay into the tapper handle so you can monitor your keg with every pour.
